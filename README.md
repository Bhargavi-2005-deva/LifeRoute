Problem:
Emergency medical services often lack real-time information about hospital capacity, specialist availability, and ICU readiness. Because of this, ambulances may take patients to hospitals that are not prepared to treat them, leading to critical delays and inefficient use of emergency resources.

Solution:
Objective:
To develop an intelligent system that predicts hospital readiness in real time and routes ambulances
based on patient condition and hospital capability — even when available data is partial or uncertain.

LifeRoute System:
We propose an Real-time hospital readiness prediction and smart ambulance routing system that:
Collects live data from hospitals (ICU beds, doctors, equipment).
Predicts hospital readiness using machine learning models.
Classifies patient severity in ambulance (Critical / Moderate / Stable).
Uses intelligent routing algorithms to find the best hospital.
Works even when some hospital data is incomplete.

Features:
Real-time hospital ICU and resource availability tracking.

AI-based hospital readiness score (0–100).

Patient severity classification (Critical / Moderate / Stable).

Intelligent ambulance routing using Dijkstra’s algorithm.

Traffic-aware navigation with live updates.

Pre-arrival hospital alert system with ETA sharing.

Smart decision engine combining readiness + distance + traffic.

Works even with partial or missing hospital data.

Multi-ambulance handling with scalable cloud backend.

Integration-ready with Smart City and national emergency systems.
